Version 2.0.11 (in progress)
============================

            [R] Change types file to allow for SEXP return values

2013-07-05: wsfulton
            [Python] Add %pythonbegin directive which works like %pythoncode, except the specified code is
            added at the beginning of the generated .py file. This is primarily needed for importing from
            __future__ statements required to be at the very beginning of the file. Example:

              %pythonbegin %{
              from __future__ import print_function
              print("Loading", "Whizz", "Bang", sep=' ... ')
              %}

            [Python] Apply SF patch #340 - Uninitialized variable fix in SWIG_Python_NonDynamicSetAttr
            when using -builtin.

2013-07-01: wsfulton
            [Python, Ruby, Ocaml] Apply SF patch #341 - fix a const_cast in generated code that was generating
            a <:: digraph when using the unary scope operator (::) (global scope) in a template type.

2013-07-01: wsfulton
            [Python] Add SF patch #342 from Christian Delbaere to fix some director classes crashing on
            object deletion when using -builtin. Fixes SF bug #1301.

2013-06-11: wsfulton
            [Python] Add SWIG_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_NO_DEBUG macro which can be defined to use the Release version
            of the Python interpreter in Debug builds of the wrappers. The Visual Studio .dsp example
            files have been modified to use this so that Debug builds will now work without having
            to install or build a Debug build of the interpreter.

2013-06-07: wsfulton
	    [Ruby] Git issue #52. Fix regression with missing rb_complex_new function for Ruby
            versions prior to 1.9 using std::complex wrappers if just using std::complex as an output type.
            Also fix the Complex helper functions external visibility (to static by default).

	    [PHP] Fix SWIG_ZTS_ConvertResourcePtr() not to dereference NULL
	    if the type lookup fails.
